# 404Hub FRONTEND coding style guide

https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react

For all of us would be easier to read and contribute code to this project, if we will stick to some simple rules while working with this project.

Contents:
1.  [Structure of the project](#structure-of-the-project)
2.  [Naming](#naming)
3.  [Code formatting](#code-formatting)
2.  [Server components vs Client components](#server-components-vs-client-components)



## Structure of the project
```
├── public
│   ├── css
├── src
│   ├── api
│   ├── app
│   ├── components
│   ├── lib
│   ├── locale
│   ├── providers
│   ├── styles
│   ├── theme
├── types
```

`public` folder contains all static files, like images, fonts, css files, etc.

`src` folder contains all source code of the project. It's divided into several subfolders:
- `app` - contains all pages of the project. Each folder inside represents route of the page. For more info read Next.js doc about routing ([here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing)).
- `api` - contains code that will do api requests to the CORE server.
- `components` - contains all Client components of the project.
  - `shared` - contains all shared components that can be used in different pages.
  - `[page-name]` - contains components that are used only in specific page.
- `lib` - contains all utility functions that can be used in different parts of the project.
- `locale` - contains all translations of the project.
- `mockups` - contains all mockups of the project. It's used for testing purposes.
- `providers` - contains all providers of the project. Each provider is responsible for providing some data to the components.
- `styles` - contains all global styles of the project.
- `theme` - contains all theme variables of the project.

## Naming
- Use camelCase for naming variables, functions, etc.
- Use PascalCase for naming components.
- Use kebab-case for naming files and folders. 
- For the typescript files use `.tsx` extension. 
- For the all type names use T prefix, like `TUser`.

## Code formatting
- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Use single quotes for strings.
- Use semicolons at the end of the statement.
- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`.

## Alignment


## Server components vs Client components
In this project we're using power of server components to make all necessary fetch requests and data manipulation right on server and provide to client only ready-to-use data.
Of course, sometimes we need to fetch some data on client side, but in most cases we should avoid it.

If component doesn't require any client specific API like onClick, useState or useEffect, it should be a server component.

Please, use `useTranslations` hook only at server components, to avoid sending translations to client.
